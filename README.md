Liferay Mobile SDK Sample
=========================

This is the sample application for the [Liferay iOS SDK](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-mobile-sdk/tree/master/ios).

It's a simple app that displays users in a table view. By clicking on an user, it will display its contact details such as: name, email, birthday and phones. By default, it uses the following credentials to authenticate:

Email: `test@liferay.com`
Password: `test`
Server: `http://localhost:8080`

You can change these values in the [SettingsUtil.m](blob/master/Util/SettingsUtil.m) class.
